# NewAge-Revamp
This is a revamp of my NewAge Engine.

THE OLD VERSION IS HERE:https://github.com/jdiperla/NewAge. It will have many of the same features that were planned, but for the time being will be restricted primarily to creating CYOA, interactive fiction, Visual Novel and Text Adventure games.


# NewAge
NewAge is an interactive fiction engine creator that features a system that will mimic a Text Adventure Game(Parser), Choose your own adventure (CYOA), interactive fiction or Visual Novel while utilizing a text parser, dialogs and/or GUI. It will feature a fully cross platform editor and a fully cross platform game engine. The goal of this software is to be intuitive and easy to use while not requiring that the developer necessarily has to have programming knowledge and can build a complete and advanced game without scripting or programming anything manually. However, scripting will be allowed optionally. Plugins, Modules and add-ons will also be supported eventually. A WYSIWYG editor will come in time. However, first I will be working on the core engine which will still allow you to make a game via scripting in Javascript and HTML. Eventually an Itch.io page will be made and donations would be appreciated.

   
### Planned Features
* Already fully Integrated commands for you to use so there is hardly any coding necessary to do on the part of the user.
   * Put on, Take Off, Use with, Use, Use on, Give to, etc... Will already be programmed in so that you have no need to do anything yourself.
* Allow the user to easily Create rooms.
   * Rooms can have descriptions, background music and sound, images, animated background images, objects, items, characters(Eventually maybe even Hotspots, Z-Buffer Zones, Shader Zones, etc.. that you can interact with). 
   * Rooms have properties that can be edited at run-time
   * Rooms can be moved in a multiple directions East, West, South, North, North West, South West, North East, South East, Up, Down, etc..
   * Rooms can have locations within it so that the user can also "Look up or Down" or look left, right, back/behind or straight ahead. Each place you look can also have its own image.
    * Create GUI's that are customizable for a desktop experience, web experience, console or mobile. 
    * Create either a visual novel, text parser game or CYOA game with a 3rd person, first person or just text view.
    * Your interface can be either option selection, typed text or graphical GUI
    * Graphical GUI's can be simple like Sierra or LucasArts.
    * Create advanced Conversations and Dialog tree's
    * Your Dialog's can run scripts, change game functionality and do more.
    * Create a fully talky and translatable game with the option to replace icons, images and sprites in your GUI, inventory, objects or backrounds
    * You can have all dialog and text translated into multiple languages
    * You can have all dialog spoken(Narrator or characters)
    * Your voice dialog can also have translations
    * Your game music can be translated
    *Inventory windows can be graphical, text based, scrollable or in different shapes using CSS.
    *Inventory Windows can have animated icons, background images.
    *Inventory Windows can have property groups(EG: Magic, Normal, weapons, etc)
