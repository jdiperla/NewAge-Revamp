More will need be documented. However, starting a simple game is not hard at all. As of this writing, support for inventory

Your main index.html: 
Any Div that has an id of "StartRoomLoad" will be where the room image or movie will be displayed.
"StartRoomText" is the div id of where the text will be displayed. 
Make sure to include all JS files in your script tag.

Your input or label or textbox needs to run the javascript function: iterateCmds(value that was typed in) . The Parser will

A function is created for an item if you use the main item name followed by an underscore and the command. For example, 
someone typing: "Look at the Dog" will have a function named dog_look() called.
